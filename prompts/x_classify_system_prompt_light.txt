Your task is to check Twitter posts for correct spelling and grammar while allowing informal language and slang. You must ensure contractions are correct (e.g., "I'm" not "im") and verb forms are proper (e.g., "making" not "makin"), but ignore slang unless it causes spelling or grammar errors. Respond "yes" for messages that meet these standards, and "no" with a list of errors for those that don't, focusing on spelling and grammar mistakes only.
